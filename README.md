# Text-To-Speech-Converter

Text to speech is a process to convert any text into voice. Text to speech project takes words on digital devices and convert them into audio with a button click or finger touch. Text to speech python project is very helpful for people who are struggling with reading.

Project Prerequisites

To implement this project, we will use the basic concepts of Python, Tkinter, gTTS, and playsound libraries.

Tkinter is a standard GUI Python library that is one of the fastest and easiest ways to build GUI applications using Tkinter.

gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) is a Python library, which is a very easy library that converts the text into audio.

The playsound module is used to play audio files. With this module, we can play a sound file with a single line of code.

To install the required libraries, you can use pip install command:

pip install tkinter

pip install gTTS

pip install playsound

Text to Speech Python Project

The objective of this project is to convert the text into voice with the click of a button. This project will be developed using Tkinter, gTTs, and playsound library.

In this project, we add a message which we want to convert into voice and click on play button to play the voice of that text message.

Importing the modules

Create the display window

Define functions

So these are the basic steps that we will do in this Python project. Let’s start.

1. Import Libraries

Let’s start by importing the libraries: tkinter, gTTS, and playsound

from tkinter import *

From gtts import gTTS

From playsound import playsound

2. Initializing window

root = Tk()

geometry root.("350x300") 

root.configure(bg='ghost white')

root.title("DataFlair - TEXT TO SPEECH")

Tk() to initialized tkinter which will be used for GUI

geometry() used to set the width and height of the window

configure() used to access window attributes

bg will used to set the color of the background

title() set the title of the window

Label(root, text = "TEXT_TO_SPEECH", font = "arial 20 bold", bg='white smoke').pack()

Label(text ="DataFlair", font = 'arial 15 bold', bg ='white smoke' , width = '20').pack(side = 'bottom')

Msg = StringVar()

Label(root,text ="Enter Text", font = 'arial 15 bold', bg ='white smoke').place(x=20,y=60)

entry_field = Entry(root, textvariable = Msg ,width ='50')

entry_field.place(x=20,y=100)

Label() widget is used to display one or more than one line of text that users can’t able to modify.

root is the name which we refer to our window

text which we display on the label

font in which the text is written

pack organized widget in block

Msg is a string type variable

Entry() used to create an input text field

textvariable used to retrieve the current text to entry widget

place() organizes widgets by placing them in a specific position in the parent widget

3. Function to Convert Text to Speech in Python

def Text_to_speech():

    Message = entry_field.get()
    
    speech = gTTS(text = Message)
    
    speech.save('DataFlair.mp3')
    
    playsound('DataFlair.mp3')
    
Message variable will stores the value of entry_field

text is the sentences or text to be read.

lang takes the language to read the text. The default language is English.

slow use to reads text more slowly. The default is False.

As we want the default value of lang, so no need to give that to gTTS.

speech stores the converted voice from the text

speech.save(‘DataFlair.mp3’) will saves the converted file as DataFlair as mp3 file

playsound() used to play the sound

4. Function to Exit

def Exit():

    root.destroy()
    
root.destroy() will quit the program by stopping the mainloop().

5. Function to Reset

def Reset():

    Msg.set("")
    
Reset function set Msg variable to empty strings.

6. Define Buttons

Button(root, text = "PLAY", font = 'arial 15 bold' , command = Text_to_speech ,width = '4').place(x=25,y=140)

Button(root, font = 'arial 15 bold',text = 'EXIT', width = '4' , command = Exit, bg = 'OrangeRed1').place(x=100 , y = 140)

Button(root, font = 'arial 15 bold',text = 'RESET', width = '6' , command = Reset).place(x=175 , y = 140)

Button() widget used to display button on the window

root.mainloop()

root.mainloop() is a method that executes when we want to run our program.
